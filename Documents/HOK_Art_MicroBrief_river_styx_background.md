# Hooked on Kharon – Micro-Brief
## River Styx Background (Painted Narrative Diorama)

---

## Asset Overview

**Asset Name:** River Styx – Background Environment  
**Asset Type:** Background / Environment Diorama

---

## Emotional Target

The River Styx background should feel **solemn, inevitable, and quietly eternal**. This is not a place of torment or spectacle, but a space defined by waiting, routine, and acceptance. The mood should suggest that this river has existed unchanged for millennia, indifferent to those who pass through it.

The player should feel like a temporary observer drifting through something vast and unconcerned with their presence.

---

## Visual Treatment

The background should read as a **painted interpretation of the Underworld**, not a literal physical landscape. Forms may be simplified or stylized to reinforce atmosphere over realism. Edges should feel softened by distance, mist, or memory rather than sharply defined.

Color values should be restrained and cohesive, favoring cool, desaturated tones with limited, purposeful highlights. Contrast should support depth layering without drawing focus away from the raft and foreground gameplay elements.

---

## Narrative Role

The River Styx background serves as a **mythic establishing space**. It communicates the nature of the Underworld as a place of passage rather than punishment.

Distant figures, architecture, or mythological presences may be visible, but only as **glimpses**—suggestions of stories unfolding elsewhere. These elements should feel timeless and observational, never staged or performative.

---

## Motion & Activity

Background motion should be **slow, ambient, and loopable**.

Examples of acceptable motion:
- Slow water movement or drifting fog
- Distant figures shifting subtly or changing posture
- Soft environmental effects suggesting scale and depth

Motion must never:
- Compete with the player or fishing actions
- Create gameplay-relevant signals
- Draw sustained focus away from the foreground

---

## Composition & Readability Notes

- Designed for a **2.5D side-scrolling camera with subtle tilt**
- Top-facing surfaces and depth layering should be readable from an angled side view
- Foreground (raft, player) remains the primary focal point
- Background contrast and saturation must remain secondary

The background should support the sensation of drifting past a living world rather than entering a staged scene.

---

## Constraints & Non-Goals

- This background does **not** affect gameplay
- No interactive elements
- No focal animation beats or visual gags
- Not intended to communicate objectives or mechanics

The goal is atmosphere and mythic presence, not spectacle.
