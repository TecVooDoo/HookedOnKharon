# Hooked on Kharon – Project Status

## Project State
**Current Phase:** Transition from Planning to Production

Hooked on Kharon has completed its initial planning and concept validation phase and is now moving into active production. Core design intent, thematic direction, and technical foundations are sufficiently defined to begin parallel asset creation and engine-side integration.

This document remains the **single authoritative internal status reference** for the project. It tracks phase, scope, risks, and readiness — not day-to-day task execution.

---

## Core Pillars (Locked)
- Atmospheric, myth-inspired setting grounded in tone rather than strict realism
- Strong silhouette readability and restrained visual complexity
- Assets designed for modular reuse and engine efficiency
- Clear separation between creative intent and production execution

---

## Development Domains

### Game Design & Systems
- Core gameplay loop: **Defined**
- Player interaction model: **Defined**
- Narrative framing and thematic goals: **Defined**
- Remaining work focused on iteration and tuning, not discovery

**Status:** Stable, low risk

---

### Unity / Technical Implementation
- Project structure: **Established and locked**
- Import standards and asset expectations: **Defined**
- Engine-side animation, state machines, and integration handled internally

Unity remains the integration endpoint for all approved assets.

**Status:** Stable, low risk

---

### Art Production (Tracked in Kitsu)
Art production has entered its execution phase and is tracked using **Kitsu**, which is managed by the lead artist and contributors.

**Scope of Kitsu:**
- Asset-level task tracking (concept, production, animation)
- Review and feedback cycles
- Status progression (WIP → Review → Approved)

**Contractual Rule:**
> Assets marked **Approved** in Kitsu are considered **Unity-ready** unless explicitly noted otherwise.

**High-Level Art State:**
- Characters: In progress / pending production alignment
- Environments: Concept direction established, production starting
- Props: Not yet started
- Animations: Pending updated production brief

This document does **not** track individual art tasks or versions.

**Status:** Active, moderate dependency risk until first approvals land

---

### External Tools
- **Kitsu:** Art and animation task execution and review (artist-managed)

No other external production tools are considered authoritative for project status.

---

## Risks & Watch Items
- Initial art → Unity handoff expectations must be validated early
- Animation scope and fidelity must remain aligned with engine constraints
- Avoid duplication of task tracking between documents and Kitsu

---

## Next Milestones
1. Finalize and distribute updated Art & Animation Production Brief
2. Confirm first wave of assets reaches **Approved** state in Kitsu
3. Validate Unity import pipeline with real production assets

---

## Notes
This status document is intentionally concise. Detailed execution lives in domain-specific tools; this document exists to answer the question:

> *“Where is the project, and what could block it?”*
