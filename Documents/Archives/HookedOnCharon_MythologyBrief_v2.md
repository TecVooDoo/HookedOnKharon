# Hooked on Kharon: Reeling in the Underworld

## Project Brief for Mythology Consultation
**Version 2 - January 2026**

---

**Developer:** TecVooDoo LLC
**Genre:** Cozy Fishing Simulation
**Platform:** PC (Steam)
**Art Style:** Low-poly 3D (stylized, not realistic)
**Tone:** Darkly whimsical - relaxing gameplay with dark comedy undertones
**Current Phase:** Planning (design complete, pre-production)

---

## The Concept

Kharon, the eternal ferryman of the dead, has an eternity to fill between soul deliveries. What does he do? He fishes.

**Hooked on Kharon** is a cozy fishing game set across the five rivers of the Greek Underworld. Players cast lines in the Acheron, Styx, Lethe, Phlegethon, and Cocytus - each river with its own atmosphere, hazards, and mythological residents.

**The Core Tension:** Kharon just wants to relax, but souls keep arriving and duty calls.

**Tagline:** "Even death needs a break."

---

## The Character

We treat Kharon not as a grim horror figure, but as a tired professional - ancient, irritable, and deeply set in his ways. He honors his role (non-payers are left behind, no exceptions), but fishing is his escape.

### The Visual Joke

Pop culture depicts Kharon as a tall, skeletal, hooded figure of dread. In this game, that's literally a costume.

| Mode | What Souls See | Reality |
|------|----------------|---------|
| On-Duty | Towering robed figure, skull face, silent menace | Short old man standing on a cooler, wearing a mask, too tired to talk |
| Off-Duty | N/A (souls delivered) | Robes unzipped, sitting on cooler, muttering about fish, petting Scorch |

The real Kharon is a short, grumpy old man - which is actually closer to ancient sources. Virgil and Aristophanes describe a scraggly bearded ferryman, not a skeleton.

**The Secret:** No one knows he's short. The cooler is his height prop.

### Scorch the Hell Hound

A small hell hound companion (possibly one of Cerberus's pups). Provides warmth, humor, and helps locate fish through proximity detection - flames brighten near good fishing spots.

**The Running Gag:** When Kharon is On-Duty, Scorch hides in his robes. Small movements are occasionally visible. Flame exits out the back when Scorch gets excited. Souls whisper to each other: "Did... did Kharon just fart fire?" Kharon remains stoically silent.

## The Setting

### Five Rivers, Five Atmospheres

| River | Domain | Atmosphere | Merchant |
|-------|--------|------------|----------|
| Acheron | Pain/Woe | Dark, murky, souls wandering the banks | Damned Merchant (punished to serve) |
| Styx | Hatred/Oaths | Purple-black waters, echoes of broken vows | Hermes (guides souls, god of commerce) |
| Lethe | Forgetfulness | Misty, dreamlike, soft and disorienting | Hypnos or Dreaming Shade |
| Phlegethon | Fire | Glowing red-orange, heat radiating | Shade of Hephaestus |
| Cocytus | Lamentation | Frozen blue, sounds of wailing | Nyx (primordial, cryptic) |

### River Navigation

Players navigate between rivers through a hub-and-spoke system with connectors. Route choices matter:

- **Phlegethon** accelerates soul decay (risky shortcut)
- **Cocytus** slows decay (safe but slow)
- **Styx** rejects oath-breakers entirely
- **Lethe** causes souls to forget their destination

Hades' mood affects which routes are available on any given day.

## Core Gameplay

### Fishing (Primary Activity)

- **Active Mode:** Manual casting, resistance-based reeling, tension management
- **Idle Mode:** Auto-cast for background progression
- **No Technology:** No fish finders or depth sensors. Use Scorch's flame intensity and environmental landmarks. Player memory matters.

### Ferrying (The Interruption)

Souls arrive needing passage. Each soul has a **decay timer** - if it expires before delivery, the soul fades and Kharon receives nothing. This creates tension between fishing (relaxation) and duty (responsibility).

**Decay rates vary:**
- Heroes decay slowly (purpose holds them together)
- Oath-breakers decay fast (spiritually compromised)
- Common shades are baseline

### The Economy

**Obols:** Standard currency from ferry payments.

**Bartered Items:** Souls without coins offer personal items instead. These become unique fishing gear with attached stories.

| Item | Source Soul | Gear Effect | Flavor Text |
|------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Fisherman's Last Lure | Drowned fisherman | Attracts spectral fish differently | "He clutched it as he sank. Now it glows faintly, remembering water that wasn't so dark." |
| Sailor's Enchanted Rope | Lost sailor | Heat-resistant (Phlegethon) | "Blessed by Poseidon for a voyage that never ended." |
| Theseus's Thread | Theseus (special guest) | Lethe-resistant | "It found its way through the labyrinth. It can find its way through fog." |
| Poet's Final Verse | Dead poet | Attracts Lethe fish | "The last words he composed. The fish here hunger for stories." |

**Design Philosophy:** These items have stories. Players remember "the drowned fisherman's lure" better than "Spectral Lure Mk. II."

### Collectibles System

Each river has rare collectibles discovered through specific activities (fishing, ferrying, certain passengers). These are high-value mythological artifacts.

**Merchant Wall Display:** Each merchant has a wall showing collectible slots. Blank spaces indicate unfound items. Trading a collectible to the merchant marks it as found on the wall and provides lore dialogue.

**The UI Philosophy:** The wall IS the tracking system. No separate menus or inventory screens for collectibles. Visual progression players can see in the game world.

**Example:** Hermes' Winged Sandal found while fishing in Acheron. Lore hook: How did the messenger god lose a sandal in the Underworld?

## Background Events

Mythological scenery visible in the distance while fishing. No interaction, no pop-ups - just there for players who notice.

### Acheron (Pain/Woe)
- Sisyphus endlessly pushing his boulder (visible on far bank, near Tartarus entrance)
- The Judges (Minos, Rhadamanthus, Aeacus) deliberating, souls lined up waiting
- Wandering shades who couldn't pay, drifting along banks

### Styx (Hatred/Oaths)
- Oath echoes: ghostly figures shouting broken promises at each other
- The Erinyes circling in the distance, hunting oath-breakers
- Thetis bathing Achilles (very rare, mythological deep cut)

### Lethe (Forgetfulness)
- Souls drinking from the river, expressions going blank
- Tantalus standing in water, reaching for fruit that pulls away
- Hypnos dozing by the bank

### Phlegethon (Fire)
- Ixion bound to his burning wheel, spinning eternally
- Pyriphlegethon Falls (waterfall of fire)
- Hephaestus's abandoned forge, still glowing

### Cocytus (Lamentation)
- The Danaids carrying water in leaky jars, endless procession
- Frozen Titans: massive shapes under the ice
- Mourning chorus: shades wailing together

## Creatures Beyond Ghost Fish

The rivers contain more than spectral versions of normal fish.

| Creature | River | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| Ketea Spawn | Cocytus | Lesser sea monsters, frozen mid-thrash |
| Oath-Manifestation Eel | Styx | Broken promises made physical, extremely slippery |
| Forgotten Thing | Lethe | Creature that forgot what it was - wrong number of fins, confused anatomy |
| Carcinos | Acheron | Shade of the giant crab Hera sent against Heracles |
| Hydra Remnant | Acheron | May "split" in inventory, taking extra space |
| Salamander | Phlegethon | Classical fire-dweller, not the amphibian |
| Lamentation Lamprey | Cocytus | Feeds on grief, emits wailing sound |

## Where Mythology Consultation Would Help

We have designed significant depth already, but want to ensure authenticity and discover opportunities we've missed.

### 1. Ferry Passengers
Who would realistically appear needing passage? We want a mix of common shades and recognizable figures. What would specific mythological figures offer as payment if they lack obols?

### 2. Authenticity Check
- Does Hermes as a merchant at Styx make sense, or would another figure fit better?
- Are there river-specific details we're missing?
- Have we misrepresented anything significant?

### 3. Deep Cuts
What obscure myths, minor figures, or forgotten stories could add texture? We want to reward players who know their mythology while remaining accessible to those who don't.

### 4. Collectibles
What mythological artifacts might Kharon find in each river? Items with stories attached - things that prompt the question "how did THIS end up here?"

### 5. Background Event Gaps
Are there lesser-known punishments, figures, or scenes that fit specific rivers?

---

## Tone and Intent

This is not a horror game or a mythology lecture. It's a relaxing fishing game that happens to be set in the Underworld. We want the setting to feel lived-in - Kharon has been doing this job forever, and the Underworld has its own rhythms and routines.

**Think:** What if the afterlife had a slow day?

We're aiming for the specificity of Supergiant's *Hades* (which treated Greek myth with care while adding personality) rather than generic "River Styx and skeletons" shorthand.

---

## Consultation Format

We're not looking for extensive writing or design work - just occasional questions and gut-checks:

- "Would this character appear in this river?"
- "What might a soul offer as barter if they died without coins?"
- "Any interesting myths involving [specific river]?"
- "Does this creature/event fit the mythology?"

Credit would be given as **Mythology Consultant** in the game's credits.

If you have students interested in a creative application of their studies, we'd welcome their input as well - with appropriate credit for contributors.
