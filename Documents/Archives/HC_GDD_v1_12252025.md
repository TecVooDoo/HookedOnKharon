## High Concept

A cozy low-poly 3D fishing sim set in the Greek Underworld. Play as Kharon, the eternal ferryman who just wants to fish in peace - but souls keep interrupting. Ferry the dead (grudgingly), collect obols, spot rare fish during runs, and upgrade your gear across the five legendary rivers of Hades.

**Tagline:** "Even death needs a break."

**Inspiration:** Cast n' Chill meets Greek Mythology

**Genre:** Casual / Cozy Fishing Sim

**Tone:** Darkly whimsical, cozy horror, grumpy immortal energy

---

## Core Pillars

| Pillar | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Cozy Horror** | Relaxing fishing with an eerie underworld atmosphere |
| **Grumpy Protagonist** | Kharon is tired, irritable, and just wants to be left alone |
| **Mythological Authenticity** | Real Greek underworld rivers, characters, and lore |
| **Simple Mechanics** | Cast n' Chill inspired - accessible, relaxing gameplay |
| **Dark Comedy** | Humor through Kharon's silent professionalism and hidden personality |

---

## Characters

### Kharon - The Ferryman

**On-Duty (Ferry Mode):**
- Tall, imposing grim reaper silhouette
- Stands at front of raft, pole in hand
- Points to direct souls, holds out hand for payment
- NEVER speaks to passengers
- Leaves non-payers behind without a word
- Professional, intimidating, mythic

**Off-Duty (Fishing Mode):**
- Robes open to reveal a smaller skeleton standing on a cooler/tackle box
- He's been faking his height the entire time
- Relaxed, sitting on cooler, rod in hand
- Mutters to himself about rare fish spots
- The only time we see the "real" Kharon

**The Secret:** No one in the underworld knows Kharon is actually short. The intimidation is an act maintained by standing on his cooler.

### Scorch - Hell Hound Companion

- Small hell hound pup (possibly Cerberus's offspring)
- Ears and tail flicker with flame when excited
- Hides in Kharon's robes during ferry duty
- Curls up under the cooler during fishing
- Helps locate fishing spots with proximity detection

**Scorch's "Bark":**
- Sounds like a whoopie cushion with a small flame puff from mouth
- When hiding in robes: Same sound and fire comes out back of Kharon's robes
- Souls are flabbergasted, wondering if Kharon just farted
- Kharon maintains complete composure, says nothing

**Proximity Detection:**
| Distance | Scorch Behavior |
|----------|-----------------|
| Far | Calm, resting |
| Getting closer | Ears perk, sniffing |
| Close | Soft growl, pacing |
| Very close | Whoopie cushion bark + flame puff |
| On the spot | Full flame-on (ears/tail ignite), excited spinning |

## Game Flow

### Core Loop

```
1. FISHING PHASE (Primary gameplay)
   - Select river/location on Erebos map
   - Cast line (Active or Idle mode)
   - Watch for fish, use Scorch for proximity
   - Reel with tension management
   - Catch fish, add to Codex, earn obols

2. FERRY INTERRUPTION
   - Soul arrives, needs passage
   - Kharon puts away rod
   - Steps onto cooler, whistles for Scorch
   - Robes close - now tall and imposing
   - Poles toward waiting soul

3. FERRY PHASE
   - Soul pays (obol) or barters item
   - Non-payers are left behind (myth-accurate)
   - During ferry, may spot rare fish
   - Kharon mutters landmark cues (3x then interrupted)
   - Delivers soul, collects payment

4. RETURN TO FISHING
   - Coast clear check
   - Robes open, steps off cooler
   - Scorch hops out
   - Optionally backtrack to spotted fish location
   - Resume fishing

5. UPGRADE PHASE
   - Visit river's merchant
   - Spend obols on better gear
   - Unlock access to new rivers
```

## The Five Rivers

Each river is a distinct biome with unique fish, hazards, and merchants.

| River | Meaning | Difficulty | Visual Theme | Merchant |
|-------|---------|------------|--------------|----------|
| **Acheron** | Pain/Woe | Beginner | Dark, murky, souls on banks | Damned Merchant |
| **Styx** | Hate | Early | Purple-black, oath echoes | Hermes |
| **Lethe** | Forgetfulness | Mid | Misty, dreamlike, soft blue | Hypnos/Dreaming Shade |
| **Phlegethon** | Fire | Advanced | Red/orange glow, heat hazard | Hephaestus's Shade |
| **Cocytus** | Lamentation | Endgame | Freezing blue, wailing sounds | Nyx |

### River Mechanics

**Soul Density Effects:**
- Too many souls nearby = Ghost fish scatter (bad spot)
- Souls feeding area = Fish grow larger/monstrous (risk/reward)

**River Hazards:**
| River | Hazard |
|-------|--------|
| Acheron | Ferry traffic interruptions |
| Styx | Oath echoes (fish aggression if line tension breaks) |
| Lethe | UI elements fade (memory-based fishing) |
| Phlegethon | Heat timer (must retreat without upgrades) |
| Cocytus | Wailing distortion (harder to see fish) |

---

## Fishing Mechanics

### Dual Modes (Cast n' Chill Inspired)

**Active Mode:**
- Manual casting with aim
- Resistance-based reeling (push/pull tension)
- Give slack when fish fights, reel when fish rests
- Higher skill, better rewards

**Idle Mode:**
- Auto-cast and reel
- Background progression
- Lower catch rate for rare fish
- Perfect for "screensaver" play

### Rare Fish Spotting (During Ferry Runs)

When Kharon spots rare fish while ferrying:

**Kharon's Muttering Pattern:**
```
MUTTER 1: "Hmm... bubbles by the skull rock..."
[Pause]
MUTTER 2: "Big shadow... skull rock, past the weeping bank..."
[Pause]
MUTTER 3: "Skull rock, weeping bank, before the falls..."
[Soul tries to speak]
KHARON: [Silence. Stares ahead. Poles faster.]
```

**Environment Markers (No Tech):**
- Landmarks (broken column, weeping willow, skull rock)
- Soul clusters (where wailing was loudest)
- River features (eddy, still pool, rapids)
- Mythological markers (Sisyphus's boulder shadow, where Orpheus turned back)

**Player Challenge:** No minimap ping - must remember visual/audio cues and backtrack.

## Merchants

Five merchants, one per river, with escalating gear:

| River | Merchant | Personality | Specialty |
|-------|----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Acheron** | Damned Merchant | Bitter, sarcastic ("I cheated customers, now I serve them forever") | Basic rods, lines, starter lures |
| **Styx** | Hermes | Fast-talking hustler ("Already guiding souls, might as well profit") | Mid-tier gear, speed upgrades |
| **Lethe** | Hypnos/Dreaming Shade | Sleepy, forgets your order, deals in "lost" items | Specialty lures, forgotten relics |
| **Phlegethon** | Hephaestus's Shade | Gruff craftsman ("Made Zeus's bolts, I can make you a rod") | Heat-resistant gear, heavy-duty |
| **Cocytus** | Nyx | Primordial, speaks in riddles, steep prices | Endgame/legendary equipment |

---

## Special Guests

Mythological figures who need ferry rides:

| River | Guests |
|-------|--------|
| **Acheron** | Orpheus (again...), random shades, lost heroes |
| **Styx** | Heracles (on another labor), oath-breakers seeking redemption |
| **Lethe** | Souls seeking rebirth, those who want to forget, Hypnos (sleepy cameo) |
| **Phlegethon** | Sinners en route to Tartarus, Tantalus, Sisyphus (on break) |
| **Cocytus** | Mourning shades, the truly damned, Persephone (visiting) |

**Guest Interactions:**
- Standard obol payment
- Barter rare items
- Share lore/hints about legendary fish

## Progression System

### Currency

## Art Style

**Artist:** Son (3D artist)

**Key Visual Elements:**
- Stylized low-poly characters and environments
- Each river has distinct color palette
- Ghostly/spectral fish with ethereal glow
- Atmospheric lighting (no sun - underworld glow)
- Background events add life to scenes

**Kharon Design:**
- Imposing robed figure (on-duty)
- Smaller skeleton revealed (off-duty)
- Cooler/tackle box as height prop
- Expressive despite being skeletal

**Scorch Design:**
- Small, cute hell hound
- Flame effects on ears/tail
- Embers for eyes
- Fits under cooler or in robes

---

## Audio Style

**Ambient:**
- River-specific sounds (wailing for Cocytus, crackling for Phlegethon)
- Distant background events (Cerberus barking, boulder rolling)
- Ethereal underworld atmosphere

**Character:**
- Kharon's muttering (rare fish cues)
- Scorch's whoopie cushion bark + flame puff
- Soul dialogue (unanswered by Kharon)

**Music:**
- Cozy but eerie background tracks
- River-specific themes
- Tension music for legendary catches

---

## Platform Considerations

**Target Platforms:** TBD (PC likely primary)

**Performance:**
- Low-poly style is performance-friendly
- Idle mode as "screensaver" option
- Should run on modest hardware
