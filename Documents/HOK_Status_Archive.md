# Hooked on Kharon - Status Archive

**Purpose:** Historical reference for completed work. This document contains design decisions, version history, and implementation details that are no longer needed in active development but may be useful for reference.

**Related Document:** `HOK_Status.md` (active status document)

**Last Updated:** January 28, 2026

## Archive Instructions

At the end of each session, move the following to this archive:

1. **Version History entries older than 5 sessions** - Keep only the most recent ~5 entries in the main status doc
2. **Completed phase design details** - Once a phase is fully complete and tested, move its detailed design here
3. **Implemented designs** - Once implemented and working, the detailed specs can be archived
4. **Resolved bug details** - Keep the bug pattern in the main doc, but detailed fix history can move here
5. **Superseded designs** - If a design was replaced, archive the old version here

**Do NOT archive:**
- Active TODO items
- Current phase work
- Architecture reference (namespaces, key files, key types)
- Lessons Learned (always needed)
- Bug Patterns to Avoid (always needed)
- Game Rules (needed during gameplay work)
- Coding Standards (always needed)
