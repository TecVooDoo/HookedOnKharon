# Hooked on Kharon – Art & Animation Production Brief (v2)

## 1. Purpose & Scope
This document defines the **global art and animation direction** for *Hooked on Kharon*. It establishes creative intent, visual rules, and production expectations for all contributors working in Kitsu.

This brief answers the question:
> *“What kind of world are we making, and what rules must all art obey?”*

It does **not** replace:
- The internal Status document (project tracking)
- Asset‑specific micro‑briefs (attached to Kitsu tasks)
- Engine or Unity implementation details

---

## 2. Project Snapshot

**Project:** Hooked on Kharon  
**Experience:** Calm, observational fishing experience set in the Greek Underworld  
**Tone:** Somber, quiet, mythic, reflective

The player drifts through the Underworld as Kharon, ferrying souls while fishing. The experience is meant to feel contemplative rather than dramatic — a sense of eternity, routine, and quiet myth.

---

## 3. Camera & World Presentation (Locked)

The game is presented as **2.5D using 3D assets**, viewed from a **side‑scrolling perspective with a subtle camera tilt**.

- The camera is **not** top‑down
- The camera is **not** isometric
- The camera is **not** perfectly side‑on

The slight tilt exists to:
- Reveal top‑facing surfaces (e.g., raft deck, shoreline planes)
- Create depth through layering
- Support painterly composition rather than flat staging

All assets must be designed to read clearly from this angled side view.

---

## 4. Core Visual Pillars (Non‑Negotiable)

All art and animation must align with these pillars:

### 1. Painterly Interpretation
The world should feel **illustrated rather than physically simulated**. Environments are interpretations of the Underworld — myth seen through memory, not realism.

### 2. Silhouette & Readability
Assets must read clearly at gameplay distance. Strong shapes are preferred over fine detail.

### 3. Restrained Complexity
Detail is deliberate. Avoid visual noise, excessive texture layering, or unnecessary motion.

### 4. Weight & Presence
Characters and animated elements should feel grounded and intentional through pose and timing.

### 5. Cohesive Atmosphere
All assets should feel as though they belong to the same quiet, living myth — not a collection of set pieces.

---

## 5. Backgrounds as Narrative Dioramas

Background environments are treated as **painted narrative dioramas**, not physical play spaces.

Their role is to:
- Establish mood and mythic presence
- Suggest life continuing beyond the player’s actions
- Reinforce the feeling of drifting through a living world

Backgrounds may include distant mythological figures or events (e.g., Hades interacting with Cerberus). These moments are:
- Non‑interactive
- Gameplay‑neutral
- Observational rather than performative

They should feel like **glimpses caught in passing**, not staged scenes.

---

## 6. Motion Philosophy

Motion across the project should be:
- Slow
- Loopable
- Ambient

Especially in backgrounds, animation should feel like **environmental breathing**, not animation beats.

### Motion Restraint Rule
Motion exists to reinforce atmosphere — **never** to compete with the player, the raft, or fishing actions.

---

## 7. Relationship to Cast n Chill (Inspirational Reference)

*Cast n Chill* is a tonal reference for how environments feel **observed rather than played**.

It is referenced for:
- Calm immersion
- Painterly composition
- Ambient world activity

It is **not** a target for:
- Asset style replication
- Pixel art techniques
- Direct visual copying

The goal is to achieve a similar *emotional read*, translated into the Underworld setting of *Hooked on Kharon*.

---

## 8. Asset Categories (High‑Level)

Detailed scope is defined in Kitsu and per‑asset micro‑briefs.

### Backgrounds
- Painted, layered dioramas
- Atmospheric perspective encouraged
- Narrative details are secondary to mood

### Characters
- Stylized but grounded proportions
- Designed for clear silhouette and animation readability

### Raft & Gameplay Surfaces
- Must read clearly as playable space
- Top‑facing surfaces are important due to camera tilt

### Props & Environment Features
- Functional or atmospheric
- Designed for reuse where appropriate

### Animations
- Clear intent, strong idles, restrained motion
- Over‑animation is discouraged

---

## 9. Kitsu Workflow Expectations

Kitsu is the **system of record** for art and animation execution.

- All art tasks are tracked in Kitsu
- Feedback occurs in Kitsu comments
- Tasks progress through WIP → Review → Approved

### Approval Contract
> Assets marked **Approved** in Kitsu are considered **Unity‑ready** unless explicitly noted otherwise.

Micro‑briefs should be attached to Kitsu tasks where additional context is required.

---

## 10. Asset Handoff Expectations (High‑Level)

- Models & animations: FBX
- Textures: PNG or TGA, power‑of‑two where applicable
- Clear, consistent naming with versioning

Unity folder structure and engine integration are handled internally.

---

## 11. Closing Note

This brief defines **shared creative ground**, not strict instructions.

Artists are encouraged to bring their expertise to the work while respecting these guardrails. Clarity, restraint, and atmosphere matter more than technical flourish.
