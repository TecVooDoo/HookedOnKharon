# Soap (ScriptableObject Architecture Pattern)

Soap helps you build cleaner, faster-to-iterate game architecture in Unity by leveraging **ScriptableObjects** for data, events, and decoupled communication.

## What to do next

- **Read the documentation**: https://obvious-game.gitbook.io/soap
- **Open and run the example scenes** included in this project (they’re the quickest way to understand common patterns).
- **Watch the video tutorials** (linked from the docs) to see end-to-end workflows.

## Getting started (quick)

1. Import Soap in your Unity project.
2. Open the Scene 1_ScriptableVariables_Example_Scene in the Examples folder.
3. Press Play
4. Click on the buttons and observe how the Scriptable Variables update in real-time.
5. Check out each element in the hierarchy to see how they are set up.

> Tip: If you’re new to Soap, start with a single variable, then scale up to events and the other types.
